![bulldozer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66157611/119805748-27498680-beff-11eb-8a4e-d56dbbfa8fac.jpg)


The data is taken from **Kaggle** competition : https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data

# PROBLEM DEFINATION

> How well can we predict the future sale price of a bulldozer,given its characteristics and previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for?

# OVERVIEW

## PrizesüèÜ

There are a $10,000 prizeüí∞ pool for this competition, with prizes awarded to the top 3 places:

* 1st place:$6,500  
* 2nd place:$2,500
* 3rd place:$1000

## Description

The goalüéØ of the contest is to predict the sale price of a particular piece of heavy equiment at auction based on it's usage, equipment type, and configuaration.  The data is sourced from auction result postings and includes information on usage and equipment configurations.

Fast Iron is creating a "blue book for bull dozers," for customers to value what their heavy equipment fleet is worth at auction.

## Evaluation


_The Evaluation Metric_ for this competition is the **RMSLE (root mean squared log error)** between the actual and predicted auction prices.

**There are 3 main datasets**

**Train.csv** is the _training set_, which contains data through the end of 2011.

**Valid.csv** is the _validation set_, which contains data from January 1, 2012 - April 30, 2012 You make predictions on this set throughout the majority of the competition. Your score on this set is used to create the public leaderboard.

**Test.csv** is the _test set_, which won't be released until the last week of the competition. It contains data from May 1, 2012 - November 2012. Your score on the test set determines your final rank for the competition.
